# Instagram Software Automation
Collaborators: Christian Lindo, Alyssa Chiego, Richardson Jacques


## About
The primary goal for this project is to test the user interaction functionalities of META’s Instagram. The testing will take place on Instagram’s website environment from functions such as logging in, to ones such as editing the current user’s bio. The underlying goal is to make sure all functions are working efficiently and properly without displaying any major bugs or errors along the way. 

The project's environment was structured using Maven, Selenium (Chrome Driver), and TestNG in IntelliJ (Java).
